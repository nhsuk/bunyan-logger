A little library to ease the sharing of the setup of the `bunyan` logger.

An instance of a `bunyan` logger is created via the [constructor-api](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#constructor-api) and returned.

When `NODE_ENV` is set to `production` the logger creates a [`slunk-bunyan-logger`](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-bunyan-logger) stream. All other environments use `stdout`. `stdout` is synchronous and should not be used in environments where performance is a concern.


## Installation

* For a specific release version (recommended): `npm install git://github.com/nhsuk/bunyan-logger.git#x.x.x` or
* For the very latest version (not recommended): `npm install nhsuk/bunyan-logger` or
* Any of the other ways to [install an npm package](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)

## Usage

```
const log = require('nhsuk-bunyan-logger')('LOGGER-NAME');

log.METHOD('message goes here');
```

Where `LOGGER-NAME` is the name you want for the logger.
Where `METHOD` is any of the supported bunyan [logger methods](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#log-method-api).
Check out the [bunyan documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bunyan) for additional information on the API.

##Â Environment Variables

A number of environment variables are used, as detailed below.

| Variable                         | Description                                                                            | Default                  | Required        |
|:---------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------|-----------------|
| `NODE_ENV`                       | node environment                                                                       | development              |                 |
| `SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN`               | [HTTP Event Collector token](http://dev.splunk.com/view/event-collector/SP-CAAAE7C)    |                          | In `production` |
| `SPLUNK_HEC_ENDPOINT`            | [HTTP Event Collector endpoint](http://dev.splunk.com/view/event-collector/SP-CAAAE7H) |                          | In `production` |
| `LOG_LEVEL`                      | [bunyan log level](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#levels)                       | Depends on `NODE_ENV`    |                 |

A note on `LOG_LEVEL` - there are default values set depending on the environment. However, if `LOG_LEVEL` is set this value will override any defaults there might be. 

[require-environment-variables](https://www.npmjs.com/package/require-environment-variables)
is used to check for the existence of required environment variables and will
throw an exception should they not be present.
